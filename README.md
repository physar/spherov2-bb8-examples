## the Sphero v2 library

The installation instructions for the Sphero v2 library can found on [Sphero v2 main page]{https://spherov2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html} by Hanbang Wang and Elionardo Feliciano. 
To install this library for a specific version of python, instead of all versions (the requirement is >> python3.7) you could use:

`python3 -m pip install spherov2 bleak`

Note that next to the library also the bleak-library is installed; this library is used for to communicate via Bluetooth.
